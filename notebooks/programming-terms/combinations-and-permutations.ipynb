    "- The difference between combinations and permutations is ordering. With permutations we care about the order of the elements, whereas with combinations we donâ€™t.\n",

    "- In Mathematics we use more precise language:\n",

    "### Combination:\n",
    "- This method takes a list and a input r as a input and return a object list of tuples which contain all possible combination of length r in a list form. Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order of input. So, if the input list is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order."
